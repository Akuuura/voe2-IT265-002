### Module: 3

### Date: [02/17/2025]

#### Goals for this Module
- [X] Finish Case Study Discussion
- [X] Keep brainstorming games to make
- [] N/A

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - I finished the Case Study Assignment on "What makes a a game bad?"
- **Challenges faced**:
  - N/A
- **Solutions**:
  - N/A

#### Learnings
- I thought a lot about what makes me personally dislike the games I think are bad, even bad mechanics in games I do enjoy. I learned that bad mechanics don't necessarily make the entire game bad, 
but leaning the game in the direcion of those bad mechanics makes the player dislike the game because they are forced to interract with those bad, unhealthy mechanics. I'll try to avoid that.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
- N/A
<!--

- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?"
  
-->

#### Next Steps
- Keep brainstorming potential boardgames to make
- Do Module 4 work
