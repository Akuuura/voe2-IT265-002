#### Goals for this Module
- [X] Finish on Cards + Decks logic
- [ ] Spend at least 3 hours working on the game itself
- [X] Finish Personal Choice Case Study

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - I worked on the game for a bit but ultimately spent a lot more time on the case study and other projects I have to do. I need to finish on making the player decks and having them interract with the player health and decks.
- **Challenges faced**
  - Decided to pivot from godot to unity because I'm, more familiar with Unity
- **Solutions**:
  - Unity.

#### Learnings
- Stacks are literally just decks, this is wonderful. 

#### Free Thinking
- I love Overwatch

#### Next Steps
- Keep working on digital prototype (hopefully to a point where I can actually present it as a prototype by then end of this weekend)
