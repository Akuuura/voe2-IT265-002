## Name: Vlariel Espinosa
### Module: 6

<!-- Repeat the below as needed-->
### Date: [03/10/2025]

#### Goals for this Module
- [X] Finish Treatment Checkpoint
- [X] Finalize my game
- [X] Begin working on physical prototype

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - I have completed designing my game and it's card + rules along with submitting my treatment checkpoint
- **Challenges faced**:
  - A lot of the time I didn't know how I should make my game or how my cards should work
- **Solutions**:
  - I spoke with others and they gave me advice and suggestions that I took into account, and ultimately decided to lean into the randomness and 50/50 chances that I do with my game

#### Learnings
- N/A

#### Free Thinking
- When actually designing a game, I feel like cohesion in mechanics is very important (and I severely overlooked this), and I felt that as I started finalizing design I lacked that. Thankfully by talking it out with friends and other people they gave me good suggestions.
<!--

- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?"
  
-->

#### Next Steps
- PHYSICAL PROTOTYPE!!!!!!
- Spring Break :)
