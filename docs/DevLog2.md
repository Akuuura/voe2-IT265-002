#### Goals for this Module
- [X] Finish the Case Study
- [X] Brainstorm games to make (part 2)
- [X] Play a bunch of Atari Super Breakout

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - I have played like 5 hours of Atari Super Breakout and finished my Case Study successfully
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered
  - Some things I needed to search just were not there and a lot of stuff was up to my interpretation and my observation, especially its influence because its not really explicitely stated along with various other things
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  - I simply thought to my own knowledge on the subject and spoke on that.

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- I explored a bit of game analysis with the Case Study, not playing a game just to play it but also looking at the visuals, sounds, and gameplay to analyse how they interract with the player.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
- I want to make a game thats just a bunch of minigames mixed into 1 simple game of first to 10. First to 10 minigame wins would win.
<!--

- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?"
  
-->

#### Next Steps
- Brainstorm a boardgames to make (which I have already started)
- Finish EVERY assignment thrown at me
