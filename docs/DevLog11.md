### Module: 11

### Date: [05/11/2025]

#### Goals for this Module
- [X] Finish Demo
- [x] Spend at least 3 hours working on the game itself
- [X] Finish Design Doc

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Ultimately it proved difficult to make my game shine as much as I wanted to, for that I feel I need a ton more time than I think I could've given myself especially with an 18 credit semester, so pats on th eback for that.
- **Challenges faced**
  - Remaking everything in Unity. Literally had to redo everything as well as redraw assets to fit the new theme so it took my 17 hours within the last 3 days to do so (I locked in)
- **Solutions**:
  - Thug it out

#### Learnings
- I need more time working with other engines as well as even working with C# and Unity and gain more experience making games. Art is one thing I can handle but I need to start being able to implement everything I make.

#### Free Thinking
- I want to make more games, and improve on this one in the future to make it real and functional, not just some demo that barely kinda works. I want more experience in this field because I do enjoy making games a ton and this class only solidified that feeling.

#### Next Steps
- Become a real Game Developer and (eventually) publish my own game.
