#### Goals for this Module
- [X] Start on Cards + Decks
- [X] Spend at least 3 hours working on the game itself
- [X] I don't now what to put here (Again)

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - I have created working decks in Godot (not all functional for the game yet, but cards exist and interact with decks). Now I have to make all the specific decks and assign cards to their decks, as well as make a shuffling script!
- **Challenges faced**
  - Again, I have never used godot so I am learning how to go about making cards, decks, and work with UI.
- **Solutions**:
  - Lots and lots of guides (and even more guides). I am considering switching back to Unity also.

#### Learnings
- Stacks are literally just decks, this is wonderful. 

#### Free Thinking
- Wondering how I'm going to go about doing my game because players are supposed to play at the same time but obviously I can't do that so I MIGHT just make it so that players pre-choose things in a turn-based fashion but make sure each player doesnt know what card the other player chose

#### Next Steps
- Keep working on digital prototype
