## Vision Statement
*What is the mission of your solo game studio? How does it align with creating and analyzing innovative game architectures?*

> [I love video games, and I found after IT286 that more than just loving them, I find creating them fun as well. I enjoy all types of games, and I want to share all the silly wacky ideas that my head can come up with, as well as make more serious games that still find ways to innovate and lift the hearts of those who play it, the same way that games have lifted mine my whole life. To make that idea a reality, I need to understand the intricacies and rules that come with designing games that have both good gameplay, and good novelty.]

## Additional Notes
*Include any other ideas, inspirations, or thoughts related to your studio or project.*

> [I have games that I'm working on currently, and one of them does not fit the wacky vibe I want to make (it's more of a passion project) but I hope that when it does release years from now it hits with an audience and the same with any other games I make under Luducrus. On a more present note, I am very excited to make a board game for this class.]
