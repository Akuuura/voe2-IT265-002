## Vision Statement
*What is the mission of your solo game studio? How does it align with creating and analyzing innovative game architectures?*

> [I love video games, and I found after IT286 that more than just loving them, I find creating them fun as well. I enjoy all types of games, and I want to share all the silly wacky ideas that my head can come up with, as well as make more serious games that still find ways to innovate and lift the hearts of those who play it, the same way that games have lifted mine my whole life. To make that idea a reality, I need to understand the intricacies and rules that come with designing games that have both good gameplay, and good novelty.]
