#### Goals for this Module
- [X] Finish Color Theory Case Study
- [X] Keep brainstorming games to make
- [ ] N/A

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - I finished my Color Theory Case Study assignment, and did it on Mario 64.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - When doing the Case Study with a game like Mario 64, there are so many different levels with different atmospheres and environments that it's hard to really nail down a central color theme.
- **Solutions**:
  - I tried to narrow my vision to specific levels when talking about how Mario 64 went about creating the atmosphere for those specific levels.

#### Learnings
- From this assignment, I really started thinking more into how colors can really create an atmosphere and even interract with the player to point them into playing a certain way or to alert
 them even without sounds. When creating an atmospheres, the colors will always dictate the feel, whether you use darker colors to make a level feel scary or tense, or you use bright and
 lighter colors to make a level feel playful and explorative, colors make what a player sees and feels. When redesigning I feel like I could have done a better job with Bowser in the Sky,
 but ultimately i feel like what I did with the lives in the UI adds another layer of urgency and indication when low on lives, and changing the stadium from green to gray makes the final
 stage feel darker and scarier as a final battle.

#### Free Thinking
- N/A

#### Next Steps
- Module 5
- Nail down a specific game out of the ones I've brainstormed that I want to make
